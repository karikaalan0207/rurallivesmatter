2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in
December 2019 in Wuhan, China and spread throughout the world in more
than 200 countries. The World Health Organization declared a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30
January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of
29 May 2021, more than 169 million cases have been confirmed around
the world, with more than 3.52 million confirmed deaths attributed to
COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in the modern
history.</p>

India, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 30 January 2020.
India ordered a nationwide lockdown for the entire population
starting 24 March 2020. By mid-May 2020, five cities (Mumbai, Delhi,
Ahmedabad, Chennai and Thane) accounted for around half of all
reported cases in the country. Infection rates started to drop in
September, along with the number of new and active cases. Daily cases
peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported per-day,
dropping to below 15,000 in January 2021.</p>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-1">Urban vs Rural</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">The
relatively better equipped urban centres are already overwhelmed with
more cases, overworked health workers and shortages of vaccines,
hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medicines. However, the
situation in rural India is much grimmer, with over 70% of India's
population, i.e. over 740 million people in India, live in rural
areas. The share of COVID cases in rural and semi-rural India
increased from 40% in mid-July 2020 to 67% in August 2020. By May
2021, more than half of all the cases in Maharashtra and Uttar
Pradesh were from rural areas.
Another
indicator of the situation in villages is the movement from villages
to semi-urban and urban areas in search of healthcare. The
pandemic is severely affecting the lives in rural and tribal areas
where medical facilities are either not available or dysfunctional.
Another issue
aggravating the situation in rural and semi-rural areas include a
severe lack of human resources in the health field. While many
Government hospitals in big cities are getting reasonable and
immediate support from various sources such as the Government,
Corporates, NGOs and Individuals, the hospitals in rural areas not
getting even the basic and essential medical resources. The rural
hospitals are lacking the continuous supply of life saving systems
like Oxygen cylinders, Concentrators and Ventilators. Many time even
essential but not so expensive items like Pulse oximeter, Infra-red
Thermometers, Masks, PPE kits, Gloves etc. are not made available to
the needy rural hospitals. Lack of Transport, timely communication
and better trained medical professionals are further complicating the
situation for rural hospitals and medical care centres.&nbsp;</p>
